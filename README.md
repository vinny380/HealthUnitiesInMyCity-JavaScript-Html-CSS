# HealthCentersInMyCity-JavaScript-Html-CSS
With this code I wanted to create a locator of Health Unities and Hospitals in my city, since Covid-19 is taking over.
I'm still building the website, and I may turn that into an app. ALSO since the original project used Google Maps API, and that one is paid,
I changed it to Leaflet's API.

Feel free to use the source code.

*Thanks to Nazariy Dumanskyy and the whole Clever Programmer team for the original open source code, we learned how to create
a Google Maps Clone as a Store Locator, then I had the idea, so I changed parts of the code, and the whole data to use that as I wanted.*

Technologies and Libraries used:
JavaScript
CSS
HTML
Leaflet API


Let's code together.
